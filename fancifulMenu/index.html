				Transitions, transforms, and some more standard CSS make a menu pop out.
				While somewhat more effusive than most modern design calls for,

				A straightforward media query responds to smaller devices by calling off the transformations and
				simplifying the look and layout to be more amenable to smaller, often mobile devices. This design
				provides an example as well for keeping the mess behind the scenes.
